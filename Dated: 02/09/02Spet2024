Started learning Angular framework via angular playground source.
Learned how to create a project, create a component in angular.
Simultaneously I make a practice in angular like conditional loops, arrays, objects.
@angular playground I completed up to Essentials tab.

Attend Mr. Koushik lecture he explained the list of skills apart from coding.
He explained, for developer what are all the skills required.
He introduced a book named "Extreme Ownership" to read.

Then, I look for input and output decorator and services its slightly confused me so I ask Priya to explain me about input and output decorator. So, she helped me.
