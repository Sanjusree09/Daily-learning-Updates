Attend Mr. Koushik lecture he explained what is problem solving.
He explained PS in three following steps:
	Understanding the problem.
	What are its constraints?
	Possible solutions with respect to the constraints.
He gave a problem to solve as HW.


Started practicing Input and output decorator but I struggled in this concept.
